# 馃殺 Crew & Chaos (Working Title)

**Crew & Chaos** is a cooperative, physics-based sailing game for mobile devices (Android/iOS), designed to be played in local multiplayer with 2鈥�4 players. Players take on different roles aboard a sailboat, each with unique tasks that require communication, coordination, and timing 鈥� all in real time.

> **Voice only 鈥� no in-game chat. Just teamwork. Just chaos.**

## 馃幆 Game Concept

- Local coop game where each player controls a specific role (Helmsman, Sail Trimmer, Lookout, Navigator).
- Every player sees the full boat from a third-person perspective.
- Players interact with physical controls 鈥� sliders, wheels, ropes 鈥� that respond to real-time boat physics.
- Voice communication only (just like in the real world).
- Designed for fun chaos, coordination, and shouting across the couch.

## 馃敡 Tech Stack

- **Engine**: Unity
- **Networking**: Unity Netcode for GameObjects (NGO)
- **Platform**: Android & iOS (local Wi-Fi multiplayer)
- **Perspective**: Third-person shared view
- **Core systems**: Physics interactions, networked controls, role-based UI overlays

## 馃幃 Gameplay Roles

| Role        | Responsibilities                                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Helmsman    | Steer the boat using a virtual wheel (circular drag) |
| Sail Trimmer| Adjust sails via rope-pulling mechanics               |
| Lookout     | Warn of obstacles, only they see water hazards       |
| Navigator   | Monitor wind direction and optimal routes            |

鉁� Ropes must be dragged and knotted  
鉁� Players must duck when the boom swings  
鉁� Communication is 100% voice 鈥� no buttons, no chat

## 馃Л How It Works

- Players select their role in a **lobby scene** (1 role per player).
- Each role has a different control overlay and tasks.
- In future versions: mid-game **role switching** via player agreement.
- Game modes may include races, storms, rescue missions.
